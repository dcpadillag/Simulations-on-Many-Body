# Self-Consistent Meand Field
The Self-Consistent Meand Field (SCMF) is a theoretical approaches to classical and quantum systems where the physical state is decribed only by the mean value of operators. This aprroach, by definition, ignores the correlations between observables.

## Example 1: Ising Model
### Ferromagnetic Ising Chain
### Anti-ferromagnetic Ising Chain

## Example 2: Hubbard Model
